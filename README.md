# IAMScanner
The goal of this assignment is to create a GoLang script that scans a Git repository
(GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) for any embedded, valid AWS IAM keys. This includes both keys
in the latest code and those in the repository's historical commits in all branches

##  Approach
To conquer this task , I had divided the project into the following steps:

-   Step 1: Clone the repository locally
-   Step 2: Traverse through all branches and, for each branch, iterate over its respective commits and their associated files
-   Step 3: Once you have started scanning the files, start looking for contents that will match the regex
-   Step 4: If there is a match output it to a folder. In my case it was under logs

## Usage
- In the terminal run the command given below:
        
        go run . <path_to_repository>

    In this case:

        go run . https://github.com/abhishek-pingsafe/Devops-Node

- You would see the progress of the repository being cloned in your terminal and right afterwards you would see the desired output in `logs` folder under the name of `output.txt`
- Currently the outputs of evey repository will be logged here. Further enhancements may include creating a seperate directory for each repository

## Enhancements Achieved

1. **Faster Execution with Parallelism**: Implemented goroutines to scan the file contents of a commit parallelly.The same can be found in `switchAndScan()` function. Specifically, the `scanFileContent()` method is called within a goroutine allowing multiple files to be scanned simultaneously. The `sync.WaitGroup (wg)` is used to coordinate and wait for all these goroutines to complete their execution before moving to the next step.

2. **Base64 Decoding**: I have added `IsBase64Encoded()` function to first check if the keys are base64 encoded. If yes then `DecodeBase64()` function is used to decode them. Implementation of both these methods can be found in `utility.go` file

3. **Extension for Other Secret Detection**: I have extend support to validate other cloud credentials & for this purpose I am using `CredentialValidator` interface that has fields for finding and then validating the credentials. This assignment is very specific to aws and you can see its usage in `validate_aws.go` file. To extend this to other cloud providers,it would require us to create another file lets say `validate_gcp.go` and then use the interface mentioned earlier to write another defination of `FindCredentials()` & `ValidateCredentials()` field. This would allows us to validate gcp credentials as well without affecting the aws defination

4. **Custom Logger**: Custom implementation that conforms to the io.Writer interface by implementing the Write method. Its purpose is to redirect any data written to it (using the Write method) to a specified output destination, which is represented by the Output field, typically an os.File


## Further Enhancements
**Baseline Definition**: Offer the capability to define a baseline file, to ignore items
during the next scan that are present in the baseline. The user should be able to
generate the baseline file with the help of this script.
This feature is useful if the user is running the script every week and doesnâ€™t want to
see the same findings again and again
